    <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
    <h3>Nov 16th 2019</h3>
    <p>Hi, my name is Patrick. For most of 2019 I&#39;ve been developing a web app for tracking gym workouts. It&#39;s called <a href="https://harderbetterfasterfitter.com"><em>Harder Better Faster Fitter</em></a>. There are plenty of gym apps out there already, so why build another? Well for starters, there aren&#39;t many that are web apps. The web apps that I saw were more like sites designed for desktop. Certainly nothing that could be used on a phone while in the gym. Also, I&#39;m building it because I think there is a market for an easy to use, no-login, no-download, gym app.</p>
<p>So it&#39;s about time that this gym app has a blog to share all the learnings that come with starting your own side project.</p>
