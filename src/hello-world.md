Hi, my name is Patrick. For most of 2019 I've been developing a web app for tracking gym workouts. It's called [_Harder Better Faster Fitter_](https://harderbetterfasterfitter.com). There are plenty of gym apps out there already, so why build another? Well for starters, there aren't many that are web apps. The web apps that I saw were more like sites designed for desktop. Certainly nothing that could be used on a phone while in the gym. Also, I'm building it because I think there is a market for an easy to use, no-login, no-download, gym app.

So it's about time that this gym app has a blog to share all the learnings that come with starting your own side project.
